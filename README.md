==========

**Slumber Kit** is a collection of Python modules created to automate various task for Dreamhost shared servers.

##Pookie - A module for fetching files from Github (or any site really) via HTTP
  
Pookie was designed to read a *package.json* (or any JSON) and expose the data to your custom Python program that uses Pookie.
This can be extremely useful for NodeJS projects. If you host nightly builds on Github and want to publish them on your site, Pookie can help
(That is what I wrote it for).

Pookie does more, essentially it can read any JSON and save files via HTTP.

Check out the *pookie-example.py* file to see how to get started.
